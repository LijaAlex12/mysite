          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p class="guitar-skill-description">A personal extension of me.I am
          emotionally and spiritually connected to my Guitar.My first love..
          I taught myself to play the guitar by listening to Paul Simon records, working it out note by note. He is an incredibly intelligent musician. He's not someone who has a natural outpouring of melody like McCartney or Dylan, who are just terribly prolific with musical ideas.
          One of my biggest thrills for me still is sitting down with a guitar or a piano and just out of nowhere trying to make a song happen.
